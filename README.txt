To run the program, please go to the flder where you have extracted the files through the terminal.
Type in "make" ("make clean" if it is not the first time you are running it).
Type in "./fruittetris"
Type in the value for the interval of blocks dropping. Do not enter 0, it will crash.
enter a value from 1 to 1000.

To play, press Up arrow to rotate, press Space to shuffle the colours.

I came accross bugs when implementing the colour matching part, so I have commented it out.
If I am still eligible for partial marks, please look at the checkFruit() function.

It is part (2) of section (d) of the assignment. I assume with the question being worth 7 marks that I have only lost 3.5 marks.
